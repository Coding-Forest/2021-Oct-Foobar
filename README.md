A surprise algorithm learning journey as an entry-level minion

This is my log for my journey throught the unexpected foobar challenge. 
I principally decided to record my experience to make sure that I learn, and later do not forget what I learn. 

All the information and code here are purely for learning purposes only.

## How do you access the problem?
In case you are overwhelmed with the interface and don't even know where you can actually read the probelm... the solution is here (I spent more than an hour looking for how to access the directory with the challenge at 2 am in the morning... I don't want anybody to do the same.):

    ls (<-- you can check the challenge folder name in neon emerald green, which is several words joined by a dash (-).)
    cd challenge-folder-name
    ls
    cat readme.txt

## Level 1

- [Minion Labor Shifts](https://github.com/Coding-Forest/2021-Oct-Foobar/blob/main/Problems/Level%201%20Minion%20Labor%20Shifts.md)

| You survived a week in Commander Lambda's organization, and you even managed to get yourself promoted. Hooray! Henchmen still don't have the kind of security access you'll need to take down Commander Lambda, though, so you'd better keep working. Chop chop!

- [Ion Flux Relabeling](https://github.com/Coding-Forest/2021-Oct-Foobar/blob/main/Problems/Level%202%20Ion%20Flux%20Relabeling.md)

| Awesome! Commander Lambda was so impressed by your efforts that you've been promoted to personal assistant. You'll be helping the Commander directly, which means you'll have access to all of Lambda's files -- including the ones on the LAMBCHOP doomsday device. This is the chance you've been waiting for. Can you use your new access to finally topple Commander Lambda's evil empire?
