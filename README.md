A surprise algorithm learning journey as an entry-level minion

This is my log for my journey throught the unexpected foobar challenge. 
I principally decided to record my experience to make sure that I learn, and later do not forget what I learn. 

All the information and code here are purely for learning purposes only.

## How do I access the problem? 
In case you are overwhelmed with the interface and don't even know where you can actually read the probelm... the solution is here (I spent more than an hour looking for how to access the directory with the challenge at 2 am in the morning... I don't want anybody to do the same.):

    cd yourID
    cd project-folder-name
    ls
    cat readme.txt
